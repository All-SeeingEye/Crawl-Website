# Crawl Starbuck
Hi this is my first python project.I got this idea from reddit and so here we are it took me 2 days to coplete this project and I am proud of this as my first project

The idea is simple make a csv file of address of all the starbucks location near Delhi. I have used selenium but if I am famous enough tht asomeone is reading this please do suggest other libraies.

This python script unfortunately only runs in startbucks india website, as html tags will be diffrent for diffrent countries wesbste if you are using this code changing only url will not work

To change the location froom Delhi to some other place see line 15 of the script

I couldnt clean up the results list in lines 40-44 using smart usage of selenium so again if you have idea future me or good stranger please do share 

This is a terrible README i hope i can do better next time.

Update:

So intial idea was starbucks cafe around a city new idea was starbucks cafe across all over India.Code is shaky and not much optimizeed but it works!
